					<h2 id="captcha">Designing with CAPTCHA</h2>
					<p>Web sites use <dfn>CAPTCHA</dfn> to protect their mail systems from spam robots, presenting the user with a simple challenge that a robot would find difficult. The word is an initialism for "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart".</p>

						</div>
					</div>
						
					<p>The primary barrier with any CAPTCHA is that it serves a test to a single sense (sight or sound), which excludes people with related disabilities.</p>
					
					<p>To make CAPTCHA as accessible as possible, WCAG 2.1 requires two Techniques and recommends some optional steps to reach the edge cases:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Provide two different modalities of CAPTCHA. For example, provide a visual task, such as typing words displayed in a image, and an audio task, such as typing letters spoken in an audio file</li>
						<li>Provide alt text saying the CAPTCHA requires completing a task and what type of task it is; for instance, "Type the word in the image" or "Type the letters spoken in the audio". When an alternate version of a CAPTCHA is available, include instructions on how to find it.</li>
						<li>Optional steps:
							<ol>
								<li>Providing more than two modalities of CAPTCHAs. For instance, a third test might be a logic puzzle.</li>
								<li>Providing access to a human customer service representative who can bypass CAPTCHA</li>
								<li>Not requiring CAPTCHAs for authorized users</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
					</ul>			
					 <p>Recent CAPTCHA technology determines a human user by analyzing, among other things, the user's cookies, plugins, and javascript objects:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The W3C Draft Note <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/">Inaccessibility of CAPTCHA</a> reports that Google's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/#version-2-are-you-a-robot">reCAPTCHA v2</a> overwhelmingly dominates CAPTCHA deployment on the web and is accessible to most users. It consists of a simple checkbox proclaiming "I'm not a robot", while under the hood the software is rigorously analyzing user data. However, the W3C Draft Note reports that keyboard navigation has been widely observed to fail, and audio CAPTCHAs are sometimes no longer being provided.</li>
						<li>Interestingly, optional step 3 of not requiring CAPTCHAs appears to be feasible. The same W3C report offers "praise and gratitude" for Google's non-interactive <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/#recap3">reCAPTCHA v3</a>, when it works. It removes v2's checkbox. The W3C authors have two caveats, both related to when v3 produces an ambiguous reliability score:
							<ul>
								<li>If the score is ambiguous Google encourages users to use reCAPTCHA v2 as backup, which has some reported barriers.</li>
								<li>Methods for disambiguating an ambiguous non-interactive score must be well documented and easily implementable, or developers will use the older backup.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>

				<h2>Notes</h2>
				<p>From Success criteria 1.1.1</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>1.1.1 Non-text Content: All non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose, except for the situations listed below. (Level A)</p>
					<p>[...]</p>
					<p>CAPTCHA: If the purpose of non-text content is to confirm that content is being accessed by a person rather than a computer, then text alternatives that identify and describe the purpose of the non-text content are provided, and alternative forms of CAPTCHA using output modes for different types of sensory perception are provided to accommodate different disabilities.</p>
					<p><acronym title="Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart">CAPTCHAs</acronym> are a controversial topic in the accessibility community. As is described in the paper <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/">Inaccessibility of CAPTCHA</a>, CAPTCHAs intrinsically push the edges of human abilities in an attempt to defeat automated processes. Every type of CAPTCHA will be unsolvable by users with certain disabilities. However, they are widely used, and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group believes that if CAPTCHAs were forbidden outright, Web sites would choose not to conform to WCAG rather than abandon CAPTCHA. This would create barriers for a great many more users with disabilities. For this reason the Working Group has chosen to structure the requirement about CAPTCHA in a way that meets the needs of most people with disabilities, yet is also considered adoptable by sites. Requiring two different forms of CAPTCHA on a given site ensures that most people with disabilities will find a form they can use.</p>
					<p>Because some users with disabilities will still not be able to access sites that meet the minimum requirements, the Working Group provides recommendations for additional steps. Organizations motivated to conform to WCAG should be aware of the importance of this topic and should go as far beyond the minimum requirements of the guidelines as possible. Additional recommended steps include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Providing more than two modalities of CAPTCHAs</li>
						<li>Providing access to a human customer service representative who can bypass CAPTCHA.</li>
						<li>Not requiring CAPTCHAs for authorized users.</li>
					</ul>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Techniques G143 and G144 must be done in unison.</p>
				<p>From Technique G143: Providing a text alternative that describes the purpose of the CAPTCHA</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>The purpose of this technique is to provide information via the text alternative that identifies the non-text content as a CAPTCHA. Such tests often involve asking the user to type in text that is presented in an obscured image or audio file. From the text alternative, the user can tell that the CAPTCHA requires completing a task and what type of task it is.</p>
						
						<p>When an alternate version of a CAPTCHA is available, the text alternative should include instructions about how to find the alternate version.</p>
						<p>Examples</p>
						<p>A CAPTCHA test asks the user to type in text that is displayed in an obscured image. The text alternative is "Type the word in the image".</p>
						<p>A CAPTCHA test asks the user to type in text that is played in an audio file. The text alternative is "Type the letters spoken in the audio".</p>
					</blockquote>
				<p>From Technique G144: Ensuring that the Web Page contains another CAPTCHA serving the same purpose using a different modality</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>The purpose of this technique is to reduce occasions in which a user with a disability cannot complete a CAPTCHA task. Because there are alternate CAPTCHA tasks that use different modalities, a user is more likely to be able to complete one of the tasks successfully.</p>
					<p>Examples</p>
					<p>A Web page that includes a CAPTCHA test that must be completed successfully before the user can advance to the next step in a process. The page includes both a visual task, such as typing words displayed in a image, and an audio task, such as typing letters spoken in an audio file. A user with hearing disabilities who cannot pass the audio CAPTCHA may be able to pass the visual CAPTCHA.</p>
					<p>A blog comment form includes a visual CAPTCHA that must be completed before a user can submit comments. In addition to the visual CAPTCHA, it includes a CAPTCHA with a form field that asks, "What is two plus seven?" with a text entry field that allows users to enter the correct answer.</p>

					<p>Note 1: CAPTCHA tests often involve asking the user to type in text that is displayed in an obscured image or audio file.</p>
					
					<p>Note 2: A Turing test is any system of tests designed to differentiate a human from a computer. It is named after famed computer scientist Alan Turing. The term was coined by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University. [CAPTCHA]</p>

				<p>IDRC section on CAPTCHA</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>SPAM robots are constantly roaming through sites to find ways of accessing unprotected  mail systems so they can be used to send unsolicited mail, or to hide the origins of SPAM emails. </p>	
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>To prevent "SPAMbots" from finding their way into Web sites, a common strategy is to use a CAPTCHA task. This strategy requires a task be completed that can only be accomplished by a human being. Figure 1 below shows a typical CAPTCHA task, in which a user identifies randomly generated letters in an image, and enters those letters into a form field, typically done while registering on a system, or using a Web form that sends email.</p>
							
							<p>CAPTCHAs can be effective for warding off SPAMbots, but they pose access barriers for some users. A person who is blind for instance would not be able to see the characters in the CAPTCHA image, and thus would be prevented from registering on the system without the help of a sighted person. It's not possible to include a text alternative of the characters in the CAPTCHA image because SPAMbots can easily be programmed to find  them. CAPTCHAs are available with audio output to get around this problem, so the blind person can hear the characters in a CAPTCHA image. But this still leaves out deaf blind users, who can not see or hear the CAPTCHA characters.  For such cases the site maintainer should provide a means for registrants to contact the site administrator, who can register the person manually. </p>
							
							<p>A variety of  CAPTCHA utilities are available on the Web, that can be copied into a site's  forms, and free services are available to generate audio CAPTCHAs:</p>
							
							<ul>
								<li><a href="http://www.captchas.net">Free CAPTCHA Service</a></li>
							</ul>
							
						</li>
						<li><p>Another method of confirming a human, and not a SPAMbot,  is registering on a Web site is to have registrants confirm their registration by replying to a message sent to their email address  This method avoids accessibility issues associated with CAPTCHA, and can be accessible to deaf blind users. Many Web applications today have email confirmation utilities built into them. </p> </li>
