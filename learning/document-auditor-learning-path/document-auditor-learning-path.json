No course can be exhaustive. Most knowledge will be gained through experience. This learning path will lay the foundation allowing you to build upon it as you practice web development and accessibility auditing.</p><p>Most training courses in this learning path will either be free, or readily paid for. (Courses are free unless a cost is listed.) Most are self-paced and start as soon as you want so you can start learning without delay.</p><p>Note: the courses provided by the Government of Canada are available in both Official Languages. The rest, however, are mostly English only.</p><p>Target Audience: </p><ul><li>Web Accessibility Auditors</li><li>Those interested in web development with an eye towards accessibility</li></ul>",
